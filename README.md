Coursera Data Analysis
Coursera Course Analysis Project
This project will perform exploratory data analysis on the dataset (link down below) and be preceeded by data cleansing.
The project will identify any missing values, any outliers, any trends in the data, look for patterns, and answer questions such as what courses are the most popular, what courses are the least popular, are difficult courses as popular as courses that are not so difficult, along with other questions.
The focus of the analysis is on what type of course would sell the most. That is, what topic and at what difficulty level would draw the largest enrollemtn of students. The analysis will try to figure that out.
